Working:
* Create a Yarn Project, Yarn Script, or Yarn Localization through the Tools > YarnSpinner menu
* Yarn scripts will re-import on change, triggering a compilation of all yarn scripts in the associated project
* Storing a compiled yarn program, a list of errors, and string tables.

TODO:
* Generate Godot localization CSV files from yarn Localization resources
* Support localized resources in Localization
* Yarn project button to generate line tags
* All runtime code and testing - views, runner
