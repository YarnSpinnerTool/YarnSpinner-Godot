Working:
* Create a Yarn Project, Yarn Script, or Yarn Localization through the Tools > YarnSpinner menu
* Manage your Yarn Project with a custom inspector which provides buttons similar to the YarnSpinner-Unity inspector
* Yarn scripts will re-import on change, triggering a compilation of all yarn scripts in the associated project
* Storing a compiled yarn program, a list of errors, line metadata, and string tables.
* Dialogue runners, commands, and functions
* Example line view and option view 

TODO:
* Generate Godot localization CSV files from yarn Localization resources
* Bug fixes / resilience
* Clean up code comments
* Update code to kill all running async tasks within the example LineView
